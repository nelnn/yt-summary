- This is what the inside
of a lithium-ion battery looks like.
It's not exactly high tech,
just two meters of foil
coated in black paste,
all packed into this
tiny 45 gram cylinder.
But these are some of the
best batteries we have.
They power everything from laptops
and electric vehicles
to orbiting satellites.
Yet when a battery fails,
all that energy can get
released in the wrong way.
- Oh my God.
- [Reporter] The latest incident
involving a lithium-ion battery.
- So how did something
so rudimentary looking
end up in almost every
electronic device on the planet?
And why don't we have anything better?
In the early 1980s, most
rechargeable batteries
were stuck at just 40 to
60 watt hours per kilogram,
meaning you would need
a kilogram of battery
to power a 40 watt light
bulb for just an hour.
As a result, when the first commercial
mobile phone launched in 1983,
it was pretty unimpressive.
It took 10 hours to charge
for just 30 minutes of talk time.
Laptops, cameras, even medical devices
all suffered from the
same bulky batteries.
Everyone from electronics giants
to oil companies were trying
to make a better battery,
because they knew that even just doubling
the energy density could unlock
a new era of portable electronics
and power the digital revolution.
But what no one realized
is that someone had
already found the solution.
In 1972, a 32-year-old British chemist
named Stanley Whittingham
was studying how different
materials store energy
at Exxon's research lab in New Jersey.
Yes, that Exxon, the
multinational oil giant,
then the largest oil company in the world.
They were researching batteries.
The next year, war broke out
between Egypt, Syria, and Israel.
When the US backed Israel,
Arab oil producers cut off
oil exports in retaliation.
And on December 22nd,
the price of crude oil
more than doubled from
$5.12 a barrel to 11.65.
In response, President
Nixon created policies
to try to keep oil prices
down, but they backfired
and the shortage only got worse.
Americans were left queuing
for hours at gas stations
as the government introduced
a rationing program.
It got so bad that they even dropped
the national speed limit
to 55 miles per hour
just to cut consumption.
At Exxon, executives were worried
that supplies would run out entirely,
so they started looking
seriously at alternatives,
like electricity.
This wasn't a new idea.
In fact, in 1900 when cars
were first taking off,
the top selling car was electric,
ahead of steam and gas powered cars.
But the problem with these electric cars
was their batteries.
They weighed 360 kilograms,
around 40% of the car's weight,
but they could only take
you around 60 kilometers.
And the energy density wasn't just low,
it also degraded over time.
Every time you recharged, it got worse.
After fewer than 500 charges,
your range would've dropped
to about 40 kilometers.
So by 1924, gas powered cars
outnumbered electric 10,000 to one.
But now that the oil
supplies were running out,
it seemed to Exxon that
there was no other solution
than to bring back the electric car,
and to do that, they needed a battery
with a much higher energy density.
So suddenly, Whittingham's side project
became a top priority.
Exxon poured in resources,
giving him free rein to,
in his words, "Do pretty
much what I wanted,
as long as it did not involve petroleum."
The very first battery dates back
to a curious incident in the 1780s
when Italian scientist Luigi Galvani
was dissecting a frog
to study its anatomy.
He anchored one side of
the frog on a brass hook
and went to cut it open
with a steel scalpel.
But when he touched the
scalpel to the frog's leg,
he noticed it suddenly twitched,
as if it had come back to life.
Galvani believed he'd discovered
a sort of animal electricity,
a living force produced
by the tissue itself.
But Galvani's rival
Alessandro Volta disagreed.
He thought it came from
the metals themselves.
And you can see this with
lots of different materials.
Veritasium producer
Gregor set up a version
of this experiment, minus
the frog, to test it out.
- [Gregor] I have zinc,
magnesium, and iron here.
I can take any of these metals,
stick them into one side of a lemon
and stick some copper on the other side.
If I hook these up to a volt meter,
I should be getting a voltage.
And we got around 0.8 volts.
Now, the reason this happens
is because some elements want to get rid
of their electrons more than others.
So if you pair one that really
doesn't want its electrons
with one that really wants some,
well, then the electrons are
gonna be traveling across.
- [Narrator] Let's look at the zinc.
What's happening here is that
zinc is losing its electrons.
The zinc ions enter the juice,
and the electrons are forced
to go through the circuit
to get to the other side.
There, hydrogen ions in the lemon juice
want those electrons,
so they receive them and
turn into hydrogen gas.
You've got one side
that gives up electrons,
that's the anode, and you've got one
that receives them, that's the cathode.
- But why do you need the lemon at all?
If there's no flow of the positive ions
through to the other side,
the electrons stop moving
almost immediately.
This happens because all of the electrons
now get bunched up in the copper,
making it extremely negatively charged,
and that is just gonna push
away any more electrons
from coming over to the other side.
- [Derek] That's because electrons
can't travel through lemon juice.
Liquids like this don't have
free electrons the way metals do,
so electrons stay in the wire.
They'll only leave the
circuit at the copper side
if there's something in the juice,
like hydrogen ions ready to take them,
and if the reaction releases enough energy
to make that transfer happen.
But positive ions in the juice can move.
They travel across to balance the charge,
allowing the current to keep flowing.
A solution that carries charge this way
by moving ions is called an electrolyte.
- But we could also do
this with the other metals
to get a similar reaction,
and we can actually quantify how much
each of these metals wants
or doesn't want electrons.
With zinc, we already
got around 0.9 volts,
but if you try it with iron, for example,
you get something lower, 0.5 or 0.6 volts.
Now, magnesium is tricky and
it would be a bit higher,
but it oxidizes so quickly
that even if I scrape
some of the oxide from the surface,
I'm still getting only around 0.7 volts.
The idea is that the larger
the voltage on the volt meter,
the more energy each electron has to give
as it passes through the circuit.
But there's also a limit to this.
See, this beaker is full of lemon juice
from the lemons we used earlier,
and they're hooked up using spoons
and these wires to a
variable power source.
Now look what happens
when I up the voltage.
You'll actually start to see
bubbles forming on both spoons,
and that's water in the lemon juice
actually being broken down
into oxygen and hydrogen gas.
This already starts
happening at 1.23 volts,
and that sets a limit on how much voltage
you can push through this electrolyte.
- Up until the early 1970s,
just about every commercial battery
used a water-based
electrolyte, and as a result,
none of these battery cells could push
much beyond the 1.23 volt limit.
Now, the total energy a battery can store
depends on how much energy
each charge has to give
times how much charge can move,
that is the battery's
voltage times its capacity.
So if you can't increase the voltage,
your only option is to make more battery,
more cells or bigger cells,
but that won't increase
the energy density.
And this is exactly the problem
Whittingham was trying to solve.
He was searching for materials
that could store large amounts of energy
in a compact space with light weight.
That led him to a class of compounds
called transition metal dichalcogenides.
He zeroed in on one in
particular, titanium disulfide.
Titanium in this compound
has effectively lost four electrons,
two to each sulfur atom,
meaning it sits at a plus
four oxidation state.
That leaves it very electron hungry,
exactly what you want
in a battery cathode.
But titanium disulfide has
a second key advantage,
this material is made of stacked layers
held together by weak
Van der Waals forces.
This creates natural gaps
between sheets of titanium
and sulfur atoms just wide enough
to let certain ions
slip between the layers,
a process known as intercalation.
Better still, the structure can expand
and contract repeatedly
without breaking down.
Now Whittingham just had to
decide which ions to use.
He initially looked at potassium,
but it was just too reactive
and far too dangerous to work with.
Oh, yeah! (laughs)
- He turned to this,
a soft, silvery metal called lithium.
What makes lithium unique is not the fact
that it has one electron
in its outer shell
that it wants to get rid of.
No, that it shares with the
other elements in its group.
What sets it apart is how much energy
you can get out of lithium
when it reacts in a battery.
See, when it loses that outer electron,
it forms a tiny, incredibly
stable positive ion,
and so that reaction paired
with the right cathode
releases more energy per
electron than any other metal.
That's why it produces the highest voltage
of any metal used in batteries.
And because it's so small
with just three protons,
lithium is also the least dense metal,
at just 0.53 grams per cubic centimeter.
This combination of low
density and the tendency
to give away its electron
made lithium perfect
for Whittingham's vision
of this high energy density battery.
But while lithium was easier
to work with than potassium,
easier still didn't mean easy.
I mean, they only let me
hold it in this glove box,
and matter of fact, here's what happens
to lithium if you put
it in a glass of water.
(water bubbles)
(tense music)
Safe to say, you don't want
this happening inside your battery.
- So, Whittingham had to switch out
the water-based electrolyte
for something else,
and that change unlocked the
possibility of higher voltages.
He turned to a solution of lithium salt
in an organic solvent, and it worked,
but it came with serious risks.
The solvent was volatile,
the lithium salt was chemically unstable.
Together, they formed a
mixture that could explode
or release toxic fumes if mishandled.
Everything had to be done
with extreme caution.
A stray spark or a trace of moisture
could destroy the
experiment or start a fire.
But if you could get around the danger,
this new electrolyte was a huge perk.
It let lithium-ions shuttle
between electrodes without
breaking down the solvent
or the cell, at least not
until much higher voltages.
Whittingham had unlocked
lithium's potential,
and in the process, he'd broken through
the 1.23 volt ceiling.
His new chemistry delivered nearly double,
a huge 2.4 volts per cell.
He now had a working prototype,
a metallic lithium anode on one side,
a titanium disulfide cathode on the other,
his new liquid electrolyte in between.
There was also a thin porous separator
that kept the electrodes apart,
so they couldn't touch and short circuit.
Here's how it works.
When you close the circuit,
lithium atoms at the anode
give up their electrons.
Those electrons travel
through the external circuit
toward the cathode, generating a current
that powers whatever's connected.
At the same time, the lithium-ions
are released into the electrolyte,
and then they pass through
the porous separator
and migrate toward the cathode.
The electrons arriving through the circuit
are taken up by the titanium atoms
and the titanium disulfide.
The positive lithium-ions
slide between the layers
to balance out the negative
charge of the electrons,
and they become locked in place.
And this process is reversible.
When you apply a voltage to recharge,
the extra electrons are
stripped from the titanium
and pulled back to the anode.
The lithium-ions are forced out
of the titanium disulfide
layers into the electrolyte,
and they too migrate to the anode
where metallic lithium reforms.
What Whittingham had created here
was a rechargeable battery,
one that worked reliably
cycle after cycle with
incredible consistency.
I don't normally think
about batteries this way,
but what they really are
is tiny little contained
chemical reactions.
And in a chemical reaction,
if you could get a 60% yield,
that would be considered good.
But in a battery,
especially one that you
wanna recharge 1000 times,
you need that reaction to
be say 99.9% efficient,
because if it's not, the
capacity of that battery
rapidly deteriorates.
If you have, say, a 95% yield,
then you'd lose a significant fraction
of lithium-ions every cycle.
After just 50 cycles, you'd only have 8%
of your original capacity left.
So that's pretty incredible
that every single lithium-ion
has to leave one electrode,
pass through the electrolyte,
and slot neatly into the
layered crystal structure
of titanium disulfide.
And then when you recharge it,
they have to leave again
cleanly without incident,
without getting stuck, make their way
all the way back to the anode.
Amazingly, despite just
being an early prototype,
Whittingham's battery
came close to that 99%.
In the winter of 1973,
Exxon's managers summoned Whittingham
to the company's New York office.
Whittingham later said, "I
went in there and explained it,
five minutes, 10 minutes at the most,
and within a week they said yes,
they wanted to invest in this."
They got to work at the Exxon laboratory,
but it wasn't all smooth sailing.
Firefighters had to be
called out repeatedly.
They were called so often,
they threatened to start charging the lab
for the special chemicals needed
to extinguish the burning lithium.
- The problem was the anode.
Whittingham's design used pure lithium,
which worked brilliantly, until it didn't.
- [Billy] We've made a special cell.
We've made a transparent battery.
- [Gregor] That's so cool.
- But they're very, very small,
so we have a microscope lens
just to allow us to see it.
What you're seeing here
is a piece of copper,
which we're gradually
plating with lithium.
So this is analogous
to the first generation
lithium metal batteries,
which use lithium metal as the anode.
On this side, we have a piece of lithium.
As we charge the battery,
we're stripping the lithium
from that electrode and we're plating it.
And actually what's happening right now
is the ideal reaction
where it's very slow.
We're getting a dense plate.
The challenge then
becomes if we go too fast.
- [Gregor] Oh, that is huge!
- Everything's fine
until all of a sudden it's not fine.
So we want the lithium to
plate evenly across everywhere,
but instead, it forms
in that one location,
and that is what is a lithium dendrite.
That lithium dendrite can grow.
The length scales of
this is on the order of,
you know, millimeters,
so that would've easily
short circuited the battery.
- [Gregor] And that dendrite
can just keep growing,
and eventually it's gonna
poke through the separator
and reach to the other side.
Now the electrons are
gonna have a shortcut,
so instead of going through the circuit,
they race straight from the anode
to the cathode using the dendrite,
and that sudden surge of
electrons cause intense heating,
and that can trigger a chain
reaction inside the battery,
leading to a fire, or even an explosion.
- For all its promise,
Whittingham's battery
was just too dangerous,
and then the oil crisis ended.
Prices dropped and Exxon's
urgency evaporated.
The company shut down its
lithium battery program.
Whittingham published his design in 1976,
and Exxon licensed the patent
to a few manufacturers,
but with no funding and no momentum,
the first lithium battery revolution died
before it had a chance to take off.
Fortunately, a copy of Whittingham's paper
made it across the Atlantic
to Oxford University in England,
where it caught the attention
of John B. Goodenough,
an American physicist leading
a solid state chemistry group.
As he read the paper, one thing stood out,
the cell voltage was being held back.
The material Whittingham
chose for the cathode,
titanium disulfide, capped
the cell at just 2.4 volts,
but Goodenough believed that
with a better cathode
material, he could do better.
He had previously worked
with compounds called
transition metal oxides.
They were more stable than sulfides,
and some he knew were
extremely hungry for electrons,
perfect for a cathode.
He tried one of these
compounds in his battery,
and the voltage immediately spiked
from 2.4 volts to four volts.
This jump was incredible.
But what was even more
surprising was the fact
that this compound
already had lithium in it.
The material was lithium cobalt oxide.
Lithium cobalt oxide is
arranged so that the cobalt
and oxygen atoms form
tightly bonded layers,
with lithium-ions nestled in between.
This means that your
supply of lithium-ions
doesn't just have to come
from the dangerous lithium
metal on the anode side,
it's already there
prebuilt into the cathode.
So theoretically, you don't
even need lithium metal at all.
You could assemble the
cell in a discharged state
with all your lithium-ions in the cathode,
then when you connect it to a charger,
these ions will get expelled
from the cathode crystal lattice
and into the electrolyte.
At the same time, nearby cobalt atoms
will give up an electron
to balance out the charge,
and those electrons
then go through the wire
to the anode to meet with the ions.
If Goodenough could find an anode
that would replace lithium metal,
the battery would become
safe enough to leave the lab
and actually power real world devices.
Goodenough was so excited about
the potential of his design
that he reached out to battery
companies across the US,
the UK and Europe, but
incredibly, no one was interested.
So he asked Oxford to file
a patent, but they refused.
So he took it to a
government lab near Oxford,
the Atomic Energy Research Establishment,
and finally, they agreed
to fund the patent,
but only if Goodenough signed
away his financial rights.
Seeing no other option, he agreed,
and the lab patented
the invention in 1981.
Now, this should have been a gold mine,
but the lab didn't realize what they had.
And so for the second time,
the lithium battery revolution
was boxed up and shelved.
This should have been a turning
point for battery science,
but bureaucracy and
inertia stalled progress.
Every field has its bottlenecks.
For batteries, it was
slow moving institutions.
For developers today, it's
slow moving code reviews.
And I can relate.
When we make these videos,
especially the ones with simulations
or complex animations,
it's rarely the ideas
that slow us down, it is the reviews.
Developers face the same thing.
They're writing code faster than ever,
thanks to tools like Copilot and Cursor.
But code reviews, well, they're
still manual and still slow.
That's where this video's
sponsor CodeRabbit comes in.
CodeRabbit automates code
reviews with generative AI.
Unlike basic tools, it
understands your code base,
your architecture, standards,
even naming conventions.
It pulls context from over 40 sources
to give feedback that
feels precise and human
and tailored to your team,
right in the Git workflow.
That's why it catches
what other tools miss,
logic errors, bad
conditions, math mistakes,
even security vulnerabilities,
like SQL injections.
The result?
Well, your senior engineers
spend less time buried in reviews
and more time solving the problems
that only humans can solve.
Try it out at CodeRabbit.link/veritasium
to cut code review time and bugs in half.
And if you're working
on open source projects,
it's completely free.
That's CodeRabbit.link/veritasium.
I would like to thank CodeRabbit
for sponsoring this part of the video.
And now back to Goodenough's design,
a breakthrough with nowhere to go, yet.
While Goodenough's battery
design was gathering dust,
10,000 kilometers away in Japan,
a 34-year-old chemist named Akira Yoshino
was trying to find a safer battery anode,
one that didn't require lithium metal.
Yoshino was actually looking at plastic.
Now, normally plastic is an insulator,
but the kind Yoshino was
looking at is different.
It's called polyacetylene,
and its carbon atoms are
arranged in a repeating chain
of single and double bonds,
a structure that gives it
unusual electronic properties.
If you tweak polyacetylene by
adding or removing electrons,
electrons can actually move
along this carbon chain.
So the plastic conducts
electricity like a metal.
And that got Yoshino thinking,
what if polyacetylene could
work as a battery anode?
During charging, it could absorb
lithium-ions and electrons,
and then during discharge, it
would give up those electrons
to the circuit, just
like lithium metal does.
If it worked, it could eliminate
the most dangerous part
of the battery, the metallic lithium.
But for months, Yoshino struggled.
Obviously, since he removed
lithium metal from the anode,
he had to get lithium-ions
from somewhere else
and he couldn't figure it out.
And then just as he was losing hope,
on the last workday of 1982
while cleaning out his office,
he stumbled upon a 1980
paper by John B. Goodenough.
It described a cathode made
of lithium cobalt oxide,
a cathode that already contained lithium.
This was the missing piece.
He sketched out the reaction
between lithium cobalt oxide
and his lithium free anode,
and then built a test cell
using the two materials.
It worked safely and reliably,
but Yoshino wasn't satisfied.
The material he used for the anode,
the polyacetylene had an
extremely low density.
I mean, it couldn't
pack in enough lithium,
so the energy density of
the battery was terrible.
Yoshino needed something
more lightweight, compact,
conductive, and crucially,
something that could reversibly accept
and release lithium-ions
within its structure
without breaking down.
He tested material after material,
and every single one failed,
until a breakthrough came
from within his own company.
Another team had developed
a new form of carbon
with a unique crystalline structure.
They called it vapor grown carbon fiber.
He got his hands on a sample,
tried it in the lab, and it worked.
To prove it, he placed a test cell
containing metallic
lithium into a safety rig,
one that's designed to test explosives.
Then he dropped a heavy iron rod onto it.
It exploded violently.
Then he ran the same test again,
but this time with his new design,
using carbon as the anode.
He charged the cell, placed it in the rig,
and dropped the rod but nothing happened.
The contrast was undeniable.
Later, Yoshino would say,
"That was the moment when the
lithium-ion battery was born."
But his employer, Asahi Chemical,
well, they weren't a battery company,
and they didn't know
how to make batteries.
So in 1986, Asahi
executive Isao Kuribayashi
flew to Boston on a top secret mission,
carrying three jars containing cathode,
anode and electrolyte materials.
He handed them to a tiny firm
called Battery Engineering,
working out of a converted truck garage,
and he asked them to turn the materials
into cylindrical cells,
like the kind you might
buy for a flashlight.
The team did just that,
completely unaware of
what they were handling.
It wasn't until 2020 that
employees learned the truth
that they had helped
assemble the world's first
pre-production lithium-ion batteries.
Two weeks later, Kuribayashi
returned to Japan
with 200 finished perfectly
functioning cells.
Even then, Asahi's leadership hesitated.
Kuribayashi refused to give up.
On the 21st of January, 1987,
he visited Sony and he took
one of the prototype cells
and rolled it across the
conference table to the Sony execs,
and at last, they saw its potential.
They reworked the design,
swapping out Yoshino's carbon material
for graphite that could better
intercalate lithium-ions
between its layers.
And in 1991, Sony launched
the first commercial lithium-ion battery
inside this, the Sony Handycam.
Their battery was compact,
rechargeable, powerful,
and crucially, free of
unstable lithium metal.
It was Sony who first coined the name
lithium-ion and it stuck.
But this wasn't just about one camcorder.
Competing companies like Panasonic
and Sanyo raced to catch up.
Lithium-ion batteries started appearing
in phones, CD players, laptops.
Manufacturers actually began to advertise
the use of lithium-ion batteries
as a key selling point of their products.
- I'm showing my age here.
I joined the industry
when lithium-ion cells
were first introduced,
and there was a Sony
camcorder that was introduced,
and then there was Dell computer.
And I still remember the
ads when Dell computer
introduced their lithium-ion battery,
and they had eight hours of runtime,
so they had an advertisement in a magazine
and it was eight pages long.
Each one was an hour longer,
so it was a big deal.
- But what's crazy is
that even after all this,
these batteries should never have worked.
See, when you charge the
battery for the first time,
lithium-ions move from the
cathode to the graphite anode.
And here, they react with the electrolyte
to form this weird complex
patchwork of compounds
that build up on the anode's surface.
These parasitic side reactions
should keep going on indefinitely,
using up all the lithium
and destroying the cell but they don't.
Instead they form a thin protective layer
known as the solid
electrolyte interface, or SEI.
It's a kind of chemical shield
protecting both the graphite anode
and the electrolyte
from further reactions.
But crucially, lithium-ions
can still slip through it.
When the SEI originally forms
during the first charging cycle,
around 5% of the lithium in the cell
actually gets stuck in this layer,
decreasing the battery's capacity.
But this little trade off
is what makes the battery stable enough
to be used for years or even decades,
which is why today lithium-ion batteries
are virtually everywhere.
From 1991 to 2023, the
price per kilowatt hour
dropped by 99% from nearly
$9,000 to just $100.
At the same time, energy
density and cycle life,
how many times a battery can be charged
and discharged before it wears
out, improved dramatically,
crossing a critical threshold.
Lithium-ion batteries had
become powerful enough
and finally cheap enough
for something bigger,
the return of the electric car.
Today, lithium-ion powers
a $100 billion industry.
In 2019, Whittingham, Goodenough
and Yoshino finally received
the Nobel Prize in
chemistry for an invention
that in the committee's words
"Revolutionized our way of life."
This made Goodenough the oldest
Nobel laureate in history,
receiving the award at the age of 97.
But lithium-ion isn't perfect.
- Scary moments aboard a JetBlue plane,
a fire erupting after
a passenger's backpack
suddenly exploded.
- Every week, inside an airplane,
there is at least one event of a battery,
of a phone, of an iPad
or a toy or something
that catches fire.
- What, every week?
- Yeah, every week.
- It's just the latest
incident aboard a plane
involving lithium-ion batteries.
- [Reporter] So far this year,
60 onboard battery incidents
through early October.
- Every flight in the US
has a bag, a specialized bag
with very thick non-flammable materials
where you put the phone inside,
and you close it, and
you still have a hazard
and you have to deal with these gases,
but now you have put
the fire ignition away
from anything else.
And if it burst into fireworks,
then at least it's in a container.
And then you tell the captain,
"We need to land immediately."
- [Derek] So what is actually happening
when a battery fails like that?
- This is a classic lithium-ion battery,
and today we're gonna do
something I always wanted to do.
We're gonna tear one down.
I guess safe to say don't do this at home.
But what would happen
if you were to do this
outside of the gloved box?
- If you charged up the cell
and then you tried to tear it up,
then you could accidentally short it,
and then it could burn
and it could even explode or fire.
If you discharged it and you opened it up,
you'd release all the different gases
and really toxic chemicals,
and if you inhale those,
then you'd probably end up in hospitals.
So at this point, we have
what we call the jelly roll.
So that's a roll off the cathode,
separates that anode.
- [Gregor] Yeah.
- Stuck together with bit of tape.
So Li Ren's just gonna
scalpel off the tape,
and then we should be able to
unroll it into a nice sheet.
- [Gregor] So these little
patches are the electrolyte or?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- [Derek S.] So as time goes by,
it'll start evaporating out.
- That is so cool.
It's so obvious when you see it,
but I don't think anyone
intuitively thinks
that it's a rolled up like sheet
of anode and cathode inside.
But these layers inside the battery,
they're not gonna stay perfect forever.
Here's an electrode from a new cell
compared to one from an old one.
You can see that the
lithium is building up
in all of the wrong places,
and if this sort of
degradation gets out of hand,
well, we're about to push the cell
past its breaking point.
How do we blow up a battery?
- So today we've got a prismatic battery.
It's a small battery
from sort of a power tool
or a phone or something similar.
We're gonna wrap it in some nichrome wire,
so we pass current through this wire.
Something like 200 watts we pass through-
- That's a lot.
- This wire.
Yeah, and it's a significant battery.
We want it to go and we want it
to go pretty spectacularly.
(tense music)
(scientists laughing)
- [Gregor] Good luck, Harry.
What we're simulating here
is a catastrophic battery failure,
the kind that could happen
if a cell is damaged or overheated,
or even just badly manufactured.
It starts around 80 degrees Celsius
when the protective SEI layer
on the anode starts to break down.
It's gonna try to reform,
but these reactions are
gonna release more heat,
and if that heat can escape,
the temperature is gonna keep rising.
How close is it to exploding now?
What do you think?
- It should burst very soon.
- Seconds.
- [Gregor] At roughly 130 degrees Celsius,
the polymer separator is gonna melt,
and now the anode and cathode
can come into direct contact,
and a massive internal short follows.
The cathode itself starts to decompose.
And because transition metal oxides
release oxygen from
their crystal structure,
they're gonna fuel the combustion,
and now the fire is just feeding itself.
Oh.
- Yes!
- Oh, oh my God.
(dramatic music)
That's really violent.
This is insane, from one
small battery like that.
- And it's only 50% state of charge.
- What we call ignition happens
inside the battery, not
outside the battery,
and it requires a fuel
or a substance that
will undergo a reaction,
it requires an oxidizer
or the equivalent oxidizer
and it requires heat.
The battery contains these three inside,
so it has its own
equivalent to an oxidizer,
its own equivalent to a fuel
and its own source of heat.
- Yeah.
- All of it in one device.
- So it's not actually lithium that burns.
A modern lithium-ion battery
like this one here contains
very little lithium, ironically.
It's actually everything else
inside here that's dangerous.
It must be really hard
putting out a battery fire
if it really has everything that it needs.
- Yeah, exactly.
So you can still put the blanket
and stop the oxygen from arriving,
but you will not, the
fire will not go to zero.
It will still, it will be smaller,
but it will still be there.
And then with water,
yeah, water has the
ability to take heat away,
so it is possible to take the heat away
from the battery with water.
The best thing is to put
and immerse the battery
into a bath of water.
- Yeah.
- It's brutal.
You can do it with one
battery, with 10 batteries,
with 15 batteries,
but when you have very
large packs of batteries
with thousands of batteries,
you cannot physically
put that under water.
- Yeah, one thing that is
popping up recently as a threat
to cities is electric car fires.
- [Guillermo] Well, we
know a lot of water works.
- Yeah, well, if there's a water source
nearby, I guess, yeah.
- Yeah, I mean, this is what they do
in some countries around the world.
They have a truck, a specialist truck
full of water, and you just take the car
that has been involved in electric fire
and they dump it into it.
- No way.
- Yeah, they do.
But, and actually it works.
- [Derek] So, how dangerous is it really?
- It's very rare.
Every million batteries, there is a fire.
- Okay.
- Right.
So that's very safe, that in the standards
of engineering, that's like,
oh, you have a good system.
One out of a million, that's fine.
But batteries are everywhere.
We don't even think about it.
So within our lifetimes, we
are going to reach a point
where we would have been exposed
to more than a million batteries,
so we would be all of us experiencing
a fire of a battery.
- With billions of
batteries in circulation,
even rare failures become inevitable.
Meanwhile, demand is skyrocketing.
By 2030, we're projected to need
